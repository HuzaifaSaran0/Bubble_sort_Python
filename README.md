# Bubble_sort_Python
## In Bubble sort we go for looping from 1st to last element and compare every two elements, and move the greater to the right side if it is on the left side
## So after every Iteration, The 1 Largest Moves to the end index, after 2nd iteration, 2nd largest moves to the second last position.
## Thats why we skip one last index every time 
## Time Complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2)
## Means it is not that efficient for large Datasets
